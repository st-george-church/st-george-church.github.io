      <p>Dear Parents, </p>
      
      <p>
         We are thrilled to announce our upcoming walkathon fundraising event organized by the Sunday school classes!
         This event offers a wonderful opportunity for our children to engage in a fun activity while supporting important
         projects for our church and Sunday school.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         The walkathon will involve children walking from Fort Langley Community Church (8870 Glover Rd)
         to Derby Reach Regional Park Heritage Area (10716 Allard Crescent, Langley TWP) and back. 
         The one-way distance is 4.7 KM and would take just over one hour. The funds raised
         will support various church and Sunday school projects.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p><strong>Event Details:</strong></p>

         Donations can be submitted in cash or via e-transfer to donation@stgeorge.ca. All donations should be collected and submitted
         by Friday, August 30th. A tax receipt will be issued for donations of $20 or more.

      </p>
      
      <p>
         When making an e-transfer, please specify that the donation is for the walkathon and include your child's name and grade.
         For example: Walkathon - John - Grade 4. 
      </p>

      <p>
         On the day of the walkathon, we encourage the children to bring a water bottle
         and wear comfortable clothing or their Nady T-shirt. After the walk, there will be a BBQ, games, a car wash, and additional
         activities, making it a day of fun and community spirit.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         We also have exciting incentives: the class that raises the most funds will win a pizza party, and the top individual
         fundraiser will receive a special prize. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Thank you for your support, and we look forward to seeing everyone at the walkathon!
         Dogs with leash are welcome in the event.
      </p>
