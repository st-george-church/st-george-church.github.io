        <p>During a recent visit to Egypt, Fr. Armia had the honor of meeting with Pope Tawadros. He presented the plans for our new church, which greatly pleased Pope Tawadros. In a special moment, Pope Tawadros blessed the new land located at 18555-88th Avenue in Surrey and bestowed a special blessing upon our new church.</p>
