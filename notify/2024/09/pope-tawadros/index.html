        <p>On a recent visit to Egypt, Fr. Armia visited Pope Tawadros and showed him
            the plans for our new church. Pope Tawadros was very pleased with the plans and
            blessed the new land at 18555-88th Avenue in Surrey. He also gave us a special 
            blessing for the new church.</p>
