      <h4>Waiver of the requirement of pre-entry visas currently applied to Canadian citizens traveling to Egypt as of December 1, 2024</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
         The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Emigration and Egyptian Expatriates announces that the Arab Republic of Egypt has decided to waive the requirement of pre-entry visas currently applied to Canadian citizens traveling to Egypt, while allowing for obtaining a visa upon arrival at Egyptian ports of entry. This is in addition to reactivating the option of applying for and obtaining an electronic visa (E-VISA). 
      </p>
      <p>
         These procedures are scheduled to take effect as of December 1, 2024 for all Canadian citizens arriving in Egyptian territories starting from that date.
      </p>
      <p>
         This decision comes within the framework of what was agreed upon during the meeting between Minister of Foreign Affairs, Emigration and Egyptian Expatriates, Dr. Badr Abdelatty, and Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs, MÃ©lanie Joly, which was held recently on the sidelines of the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. 
      </p>

      <p>
         As part of this year&apos;s marking of the seventieth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Egypt and Canada, and both sides&apos; agreement on the importance of contributing together to facilitating and easing mutual trade and tourism flow, as well as striving towards facilitating mobility and visas for both countries&apos; nationals, the decision to waive the pre-entry visas applied to Canadian citizens stems from the common desire to promote all aspects of cooperation and endeavor towards further facilitation by all available means for citizens of both countries, including Egyptian-Canadian citizens, and connecting them with their motherland, Egypt. This comes in the framework of President El-Sisi&apos;s directives to give top priority to serving the interests of Egyptian nationals abroad and removing any obstacles they may face.
