      <p>Dear Beloved Congregation,</p>

      <p>
         We hope you are all keeping warm as we step into this blessed Nativity season! We&apos;re writing today with
         hearts full of gratitude — and a little bit of holy excitement 😊.
      </p>

         As you know, November&apos;s &quot;Our Hands, Our Hearts for His House&quot; fundraising drive had a goal of
         $100,000. Well… by the
         grace of God and the intercessions of St. George, we didn&apos;t just reach that goal — we surpassed it!
      </p>

      <p>✨ Total Raised in November: $123,000! ✨ </p>

      <p>
         Yes, you read that right. Your generosity, prayers, and commitment to rebuilding our beloved church continue to
         shine so
         brightly. Thank you for your faithfulness and for every contribution, big and small. Truly, “the generous soul
         will be
         made rich” (Proverbs 11:25).
      </p>

         Now, with December upon us, it&apos;s time to turn the page to our next joyful chapter:
         &quot;Lighting the Way - Nativity Month of Giving&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
         Since our community has shown such love and dedication — and because December is the final month for donations
         to be
         included on this year&apos;s tax receipts — we&apos;re setting an optimistic and faith-filled goal of $250,000
         for this month! 😊
      </p>

      <p>
         It&apos;s bold, yes… but so is our mission. And if there&apos;s anything we&apos;ve learned, it&apos;s that
         this congregation shines
         brightest when we come together with one heart and one purpose.
      </p>


      <p>
         With regards to the project, we've resubmitted the Building Permit package and their review process is still
         underway
         with the City; however, we're happy to share that the City's Fire Department has completed their portion and
         have
         approved our submission. We continue to wait for the full Building Approval which we hope to receive in the
         next few
         weeks.
      </p>

      <p>
         Thank you again for your incredible support. May God reward your generosity and bless your homes with peace and
         joy
         during this holy season.
      </p>

      <p>
         With love in Christ,<br />
