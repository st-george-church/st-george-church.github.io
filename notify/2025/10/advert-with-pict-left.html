Dear Congregation,<br /><br />
As mentioned last Sunday, we have begun our &apos;Bricks & Blessings&apos; October Drive with a target of $100,000 by the end of the month. We are happy to announce that we raised $21,000 so far. We would love to see a few more people committing to monthly donations before the end of the month! Thank you everyone who has already participated!
