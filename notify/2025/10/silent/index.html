         <p>We are happy to announce that this Sunday we will have a Silent Auction for a
            beautiful Icon of St. Philopateerâ€” a very big blessing!
            The auction will be only this Sunday and the next one.</p>

         <p>There will also be a spiritual bookstore with wonderful books, icons, and gifts for both adults and kids â€”
            full of inspiring and faith-filled items.
            (once/month)</p>

         <p>ðŸ’’ All money raised from the auction and the bookstore will go toward building our new church.</p>
