        <p>Dear congregation,</p>

        <p>
            We kindly encourage everyone to bring their bottles to the Sunday service and hand them to Mina Fahim or
            Magued Guabour
            for return.
        </p>

        <p>
            So far this year, your contributions have raised over $700. While it may not seem like a large amount, every
            little bit
            truly makes a difference. To put it in perspective:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>$700 covers 28 hours of rent at Walnut Grove Lutheran Church - enough for 14 Wednesday services.</li>
            <li>If we reach $1,300 this year, that would cover all 52 Wednesday services for the year!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Imagine the impact if each of our 300 families brought in just $2 worth of bottles per month. Together, that
            would add
            up to $600 per month - more than $7,000 annually for fundraising.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please do not throw your bottles away. Gather them in a clear bag and bring them whenever you can. Mina and
            Magued will
            be happy to collect them. With your help, we can reach our goal of $1,000 by December 2025.
        </p>

        <p>
            May God bless your service and reward you with His heavenly grace. Thank you for your continued support.
