        <p>Brothers and Sisters in Christ,</p>

        <p>We are thrilled to share that, thanks to your generosity, over 4,000 bottles have
            been returned to the recycle depot. This has generated about $400 for St. George Coptic Orthodox Church.
            As part of our ongoing fundraising initiative for the new church, we invite everyone to continue supporting
            this effort through Return-It. Simply collect your beverage containers in a clear (transparent or blue) bag,
            print a label at any Return-It Express location using account number 604-300-4235, and drop off your bag -
            no sorting required.</p>

        <p>If you prefer not to visit the depot yourself, you can bring your containers in a clear plastic bag
            to church on Sundays and hand it to Mina Fahim, and he will take care of the rest.
            Either way, your contribution helps grow our church and blesses our community.</p>

        <p>Accepted containers include aluminum cans, plastic and glass bottles, drink boxes, gable tops, pouches,
            and more. Every bottle counts!</p>

        <p>Thank you for your continued support,
            and may God bless you.</p>
