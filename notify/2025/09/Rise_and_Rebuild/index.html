         <p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">"Then I said to them, 'You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been
            burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace.'" -
            Nehemiah 2:17</p>

         <p>Dear Beloved Members of Our Church Family,</p>

         <p>I pray this message finds you in peace and grace.</p>

         <p>Since the burn down of our church building, we have journeyed together through prayer, fellowship, and
            resilience to re-build St. George Church.</p>

         <p>Today, we stand at a pivotal moment - a moment to rise and rebuild the house of the Lord, just as Nehemiah
            once called his people to do.</p>

         <p>The vision for our new church home is not just about bricks and mortar. It is about restoring a sacred space
            where we gather to worship, celebrate, mourn, and grow in faith.</p>

         <p>It is about creating a lasting legacy for generations to come and, we are just a couple of weeks away from
            submitting our revised building application permit.</p>

         <p>To bring this vision to life, we humbly ask for your continued and increased support through increased
            monthly donations. Every contribution - no matter the size - is a vital part of this mission.</p>

         <p>Your generosity fuels the foundation of our rebuilding efforts and sustains the many commitments we have made
            to architects, contractors, surveyors, and community outreach.</p>

         <p>We know that times are challenging, and we ask only what each heart feels called to give. If you are able to
            increase your monthly offering, even modestly, it will make a profound difference on our financial strain.
         </p>
         
         <p>Together, we can ensure that our church rises again - stronger, more welcoming, and filled with the Spirit.
         </p>

         <p>Let us rebuild our church together.</p>

         <p>Monthly donations can be set as follows:</p>

         <ul>
            <li>e-Transfers to <a href="mailto:donation@stgeorge.ca">donation@stgeorge.ca</a></li>

            <li>Personal Post Dated Cheques</li>
         </ul>


         <p>Also, the church is now accepting 2-3 years Loans from members of the congregation in denominations of
            $10,000 or multiples of the same at the very attractive interest rate of 3.5% per annum (to be paid out or
            donated and receipted).</p>

         <p>Your kindness and generosity is greatly appreciated.</p>

         <p>Thank you and God bless.</p>
