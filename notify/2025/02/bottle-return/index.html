    <h3>Brothers and Sisters in Christ,</h3>
    <p>We are excited to announce a fundraising initiative for our new church! We will be collecting bottles through Return-It. Our treasurer will have full access to the account and will periodically transfer funds to the church bank account.</p>
    <h3>How to Participate:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Collect your beverage containers in a clear (transparent or blue) bag.</li>
        <li>Find the nearest Return-It Express location <a href="https://return-it.ca/locations/express" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
        <li>At the depot, print a label for your bags using the account number 604-300-4235. Attach the label to the transparent bag.</li>
        <li>Drop off your bag! No sorting necessary.</li>
    </ol>
