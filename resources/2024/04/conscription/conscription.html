    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of State for Immigration and Affairs of 
    Egyptians Abroad received numerous requests from citizens abroad about the possibility of 
    regularizing their conscription status. Out of the Egyptian state's determination to provide 
    all facilities to the people of the country abroad, and to stabilize their social 
    situation (whether work - study - treatment), it was decided on the following:
  </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Registration will be opened on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website as of May 1, 2024, for a period of two months, and this will be announced on various media outlets.</li>
      <li>Requests for final settlement of conscription status will be received at the initiative of the Egyptian state, provided that all requests will be entered on the website. This pertains to Egyptians abroad who have reached the age of military conscription starting from the age of 18 years at the date of registration on the website until the age of 30 years, as well as those over the age of 30 years to settle their conscription status according to their situation.</li>
      <li>
        Applicants must provide:
        
          <ul>
            <li>a certificate certified by either our embassy or consulate, indicating that the young man is abroad,</li>
            <li>and a receipt from the recognized bank indicating that required fee is paid in full.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
        <li>It is not allowed to renew passports for Egyptians abroad until their military conscription status is settled.</li>
        <li>The data required, as well as the specifics and conditions of the matter, 
          will be available at official website <a href="https://www.tagneedinit.gov.eg">https://www.tagneedinit.gov.eg</a>.</li>
        <li>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs calls on all Egyptian citizens residing abroad to quickly register on the Ministryâ€™s website within the specified period to quickly settle their conscription status permanently through this initiative.</li>
    </ol>
   
  <p>May God grant you success.</p>
